# Memory Clicky Game

Overview:
For this project, I created a memory, clicky game using React. The goal was to break the UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Instructions:
 - Create a new React application using Create React App
 - The app should render differnet images to the screen, and each image should listen for click events
 - The app should keep track of the player's score - incremented when clicking on an image for the first time; and reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once
 - Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order
 - Once the player's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart
 - The application keeps track of the player's high score and updates when the user achieves a new high score
